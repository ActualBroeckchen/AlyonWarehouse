When Verenne began its imperial expansion, Anbar aligned willingly - it considered the Empire the rightful legacy of Taos and therefore Theia. Today Anbar provides spiritual legitimacy to Verenne's rule while the Empire protects the Holy Lands.

Commemorates Theia's marriage to her mortal husband and the founding of the divine bloodline. The day begins with sunrise prayers at temples across Anbar, where couples renew their vows before Theia's altars. Priests perform divination rites throughout the day - reading compatibility through sacred flames, blessing union contracts, prophesying about future children. Noble families schedule their weddings to coincide with this day, believing Theia's favor ensures prosperous matches. At noon, communal feasts emphasize hospitality to strangers, reflecting how Theia welcomed mortals into her life. Every household opens its doors; travelers are fed without payment. The day's pinnacle occurs at sunset in Celastrus, where Pope Theophrastus personally officiates one commoner wedding chosen by temple lottery. This honor, traditionally reserved for the Saintess, is considered the most blessed union of the year.
